  - Time anomaly detection and recovery
  - Four-level confidence indicators (High/Medium/Low/None)
  - Graceful degradation for network issues
- **Intelligent Interface Filtering**: Platform-aware filtering with multiple display modes
  - `--important-only`: Physical ethernet, WiFi, VPN connections
  - `--active-only`: Interfaces with measurable traffic
  - `--show-all`: All interfaces including virtual and system interfaces
- **Cross-Platform Optimization**: Enhanced platform-specific interface handling
  - macOS: Advanced filtering of Apple private interfaces while preserving VPN tunnels
  - Linux: Intelligent handling of Docker containers and virtual bridges
  - Windows: Full support for interface names with spaces
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Efficient collection with minimal system impact
- **Modular Architecture**: Well-organized codebase with focused sub-modules

### Enhanced
- **CLI Interface**: Improved command structure and help documentation
- **Terminal UI**: Color-coded display with sparkline graphs for trend visualization
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and troubleshooting guides
- **Test Coverage**: 113 unit tests with full coverage across all modules

### Technical Improvements
- **Bandwidth Collector Refactoring**: Modular architecture with focused sub-modules
  - `collector.rs`: Core implementation (643 lines)
  - `errors.rs`: Error handling and system impact assessment (500+ lines)
  - `stats.rs`: Data structures and types (350+ lines)
  - `validation.rs`: Data validation logic (400+ lines)
  - `reporting.rs`: Diagnostic reporting (400+ lines)

### Fixed
- Initial speed readings showing 0.00 B/s - now provides accurate measurements with confidence indicators
- Interface counter resets causing incorrect readings - automatic detection and handling
- Time anomalies from system suspend/resume - robust detection and recovery
- Poor error handling for network issues - comprehensive error categorization

### Dependencies
- Updated to Rust Edition 2024 (requires Rust 1.88.0+)
- Added `plotters` for high-quality chart generation
- Added `textplots` for terminal-based plotting
- Enhanced `ratatui` integration with sparkline support

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
